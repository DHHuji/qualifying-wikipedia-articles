Using Wikidata to qualify Wikipedia articles

The project is led by Dr. Rona Aviram. 
The presented code is written by Nika Faynberg with support of ChatGPT. 

We have composed 3 scripts, all available also in our github:
I. Wikidata classifier
  - With existing article list: "17/10 WikiData_properties_for_manual_corpus.ipynb"
  - Creating a new corpus (based on the corpus builder): "Corpus builder + WikiData_properties_code1710.ipynb" 
II. Section extractor and edit counts per section
  - 19/11 Extraction_of_sections_diff_and_plots.ipynb
